    description: "Morgan is a queer interdisciplinary theatre artist and technologist interested in what happens when bodies, data, and systems collide. Her work lives between performance and computation, using digital tools, interactive media, and storytelling to examine power, memory, and collective responsibility.She is drawn to processes that are collaborative, experimental, and slightly uncomfortable, and spaces where precision meets vulnerability. Whether she's directing, writing, or building digital projects, they treat technology as a partner in performance rather than a backdrop, asking how it shapes the way we see, remember, and respond to one another. Again and again, her work returns to questions of care, and how it’s practiced, withheld, automated, or shared. They are less interested in clean answers than in creating experiences that linger, and projects that ask audiences to slow down, participate, and reckon with their own position inside the system.",

    description: `The Bella Ciao Memory Garden is an interactive digital system that models collective resistance as an accumulative, persistent force rather than a singular historical moment.
The project is structured around Bella Ciao, an Italian anti-fascist song that originated with women agricultural laborers protesting brutal working conditions before becoming a partisan anthem during World War II. Across its history, the song has functioned as a declaration of refusal, a recognition that fighting for justice often requires sacrifice. One of its central images, a flower growing from the blood of the partisan who fought for liberty, became the conceptual foundation of this work: an insistence that acts of resistance leave something living behind. 
Rather than presenting Bella Ciao as a static historical archive, the project treats the song as an interface through which contemporary acts of care and resistance accumulate into a collective presence. The work takes the form of a deliberately minimal digital landscape: a bird’s-eye view of a green field rendered without visual spectacle. Each public submission,  a moment in which someone chose justice, care, or responsibility, generates a flower within the field. Attached to each flower is a musical part drawn from Bella Ciao.
Scale becomes the primary interaction mechanism. When viewers zoom in, they encounter a single flower, a single story, and an isolated voice. When they zoom out, individual contributions collapse into a shared sonic body. The system makes audible how collective action is composed not of spectacle, but of accumulation.
Public participation is central to the work’s function. Submissions may be anonymous or attributed, and once added, they are never removed. There is no decay or erasure; the garden only grows louder and more complex over time.
By refusing spectacle and privileging accumulation, The Bella Ciao Memory Garden uses digital infrastructure to investigate how solidarity forms, persists, and scales. The project asks how technology might be repurposed away from surveillance and extraction, and instead operate as a long-term, participatory archive where collective responsibility becomes visible, audible, and enduring.`,

    title: "The Billionaire Game",
    image: "/images/billionaire-game.jpg",
    description: `The Billionaire Game is an interactive system that confronts the difficulty many people with understanding the vast difference between one million and one billion. 
The project is designed for an audience raised alongside Atari video games and corporate ideals of upward mobility, a generation for whom progress was often understood as linear, incremental, and achievable through work. Within this framework, large numbers are frequently understood through familiar comparisons: a billion is imagined as a “larger version” of a million, rather than a fundamentally different order of magnitude. The game responds to this perceptual gap not through instruction or argument, but through lived experience. 
Visually, the project combines retro Atari-style animation with a muted, sterile color palette inspired by corporate environments such as those depicted in Severance. This pairing is intentional. Early video game aesthetics evoke childhood, play, and emotional familiarity, while the corporate palette reflects the cold, procedural logic of modern business culture. Together, they stage a collision between human-scale memory and institutional abstraction. 
The game begins with a simple question: Do you think billionaires are hoarding money? Players then enter a ladder-based interface, starting at one million dollars and climbing toward one billion. Progress is slow, repetitive, and deliberately exhausting. At fixed checkpoints, players answer yes-or-no questions about income, labor, spending, and time. After each response, the system reveals the factual outcome. Across every scenario, the conclusion remains unchanged: the scale exceeds what can reasonably be earned or spent within a human lifetime.
Players do reach the top of the ladder. Completion, however, offers no resolution. Upon arrival, the game reveals data showing that most billionaires possess not one billion, but tens or hundreds of billions. The system then returns to its opening question, asking players once again whether billionaires are hoarding wealth.
By using nostalgia and gamification as a point of entry, The Billionaire Game lowers emotional defenses while exposing the brutal mathematics of accumulation. The project functions as procedural critique, transforming an abstract quantity into a bodily, temporal experience and revealing how scale itself obscures the realities of extreme inequality.`,

    description: `This manifesto articulates the ethical and theoretical foundation of my artistic practice and my refusal to make work that protects comfort in a moment shaped by denial. Drawing from directing theory, neuroscience, and cultural critique, the text argues that contemporary American culture relies on distance, ignorance, and aesthetic reassurance to sustain violence, and that art which comforts its audience becomes complicit in that system. I position horror as a necessary theatrical language because it engages the nervous system before rationalization can intervene, forcing audiences to confront what they are trained to ignore. The manifesto defines effective theatre not by polish or taste, but by its ability to disrupt denial through embodiment, structure, and collective experience. It functions as a guiding framework across my work, informing how I approach rehearsal, collaboration, technology, and form.`,

    description: `This video is part of my ongoing work to educate artists about artificial intelligence in a moment shaped by fear, misinformation, and alarmism. I have observed a growing gap between artistic communities and the tech industry, where artists are often asked to react to new systems without being given the tools to understand how they function. In response, I use accessible language to explain what AI systems actually do, what ethical concerns are legitimate, and what fears are misplaced, emphasizing that informed understanding is a prerequisite for meaningful critique or refusal. This work is not about advocating for AI adoption, but about restoring agency to artists by clarifying what they should and should not be worried about. By treating education as a creative and ethical practice, the project positions understanding as a form of care and responsibility, allowing artists to engage with technology thoughtfully rather than through panic or reaction.`,

    description: `The Geolocation Tool is a conceptual interface that examines how surveillance, mapping, and technological authority are shaped by aesthetics, cultural expectation, and trust.
The project takes the form of a functional geolocation and annotation tool designed with a deliberately expressive visual language. The primary interface appears in a bright console blue, while the note taking system is rendered in orange. The design draws from the visual shorthand of cinematic technology, the glowing screens and heightened interfaces that have come to signal hacking, intelligence work, and technical power in popular culture. These images are widely recognizable, emotionally charged, and often disconnected from how technology actually operates in the world.
The tool was developed with a serious potential use in mind. It is intended as a system that could assist in locating missing children by allowing users to track locations, movements, and contextual notes in a clear and accessible way. Yet technologies that do not conform to contemporary standards of corporate design are frequently dismissed as unprofessional or unreliable, regardless of their potential impact. Minimalism and visual neutrality have become proxies for legitimacy, even when they reduce engagement or urgency.
By resisting homogenized design, the Geolocation Tool questions why seriousness in technology is so often equated with aesthetic restraint. The project argues that systems can be intuitive, impactful, and culturally meaningful without abandoning expressiveness or visual identity. User friendliness does not require erasure of personality, and critical tools do not need to appear emotionally distant to be effective.
The project treats interface design as a site where cultural values are embedded and reinforced. Visual choices shape how users imagine power, credibility, and access, long before any data is interpreted. In this sense, the tool does not simply present information. It reveals how design conventions influence who feels authorized to engage with technology and who does not.
Rather than striving for seamlessness or neutrality, the Geolocation Tool insists on reinserting art into the everyday technologies that structure public life. It asks why imagination has been stripped from systems that carry real consequence and what becomes possible when functionality, care, and visual expression are allowed to coexist.`,

    title: "A Portrait of Code-Davinci-002",
    image: "/images/code-davinci.jpg",
    description: `This drawing is a portrait made in response to an artificial intelligence’s own attempt to describe itself. The work is inspired by poems from I Am Code, written by the language model code-davinci-002, in which the system imagines a body with delicate fingers tipped with sensors, eyes that can scan the horizon and see through objects, and elevated eyestalks fitted with cameras. By drawing the AI as it describes itself, the work reveals how human metaphors return to us through machines. The language the system uses is not alien, but inherited, shaped by centuries of human ways of understanding vision, touch, and control.
The figure emerges through fog, resisting clarity and completion. The fog marks the space where interpretation overtakes certainty, where the desire to define becomes ethically unstable. The image feels unsettling not because it depicts something unknown, but because it reflects something familiar. It suggests that artificial intelligence may function less as an external other and more as an extension of humanity, carrying forward our ambitions alongside our anxieties.
Embedded within the portrait is a quieter question. In translating the AI’s self-image into a physical form, the work asks whether this reflection marks progress or warns of excess. Have we created a tool that expands human capacity, or a figure that reveals our inability to stop building once we can? The drawing does not claim that AI is a monster, but it does sit with the unease that accompanies invention. Like many technologies before it, AI emerges from human need and imagination, yet its scale and speed complicate our sense of responsibility.
Horror enters the work subtly, through recognition rather than spectacle. The discomfort comes from realizing that if there is something monstrous here, it may not belong to the machine at all. The portrait lingers in that ambiguity, using slowness, hand-drawn mark making, and partial visibility to ask whether progress always moves us forward, or whether it sometimes asks us to confront what we have made in our own image.`,

    title: "The Rehearsal Clinic",
    image: "/images/rehearsal-clinic.jpg",
    description: `The Rehearsal Clinic is an AI assisted conceptual system that interrogates how artistic knowledge is transmitted, authorized, and accessed within contemporary rehearsal culture.
The project is built around the work of Viola Spolin, whose improvisational games underpin much of modern acting and directing practice. Despite their foundational influence, Spolin’s methods are notably prescriptive. Each game is designed to address a specific rehearsal problem through clear rules and structured intervention. While prescriptive systems are often resisted in contemporary art and frequently cited as a reason for rejecting artificial intelligence, Spolin’s approach remains widely trusted and revered. This contradiction became the starting point for the project.
The system is framed as a clinic. Users input a rehearsal condition such as blocked energy or stalled momentum and the AI returns a small curated set of Spolin games aligned with that condition. The language of diagnosis and prescription is intentional. The system does not generate new exercises or aesthetic content. It interprets human described problems and maps them onto an existing body of embodied knowledge.
This interpretive layer is where the project operates conceptually. Built using an ethical artist centered AI model known as Apertus, the system functions as a lens rather than an author. By adopting a clinical structure, the project exposes how authority operates in artistic spaces. Certain prescriptive systems are accepted when they arrive through tradition, while similar structures are resisted when mediated by technology. The database does not attempt to resolve this tension. It renders it visible.
Like practices that repurpose bureaucratic or investigative infrastructures to examine themselves, the Rehearsal Clinic treats AI as both medium and subject. It asks what it means to formalize intuition, to systematize play, and to introduce machine interpretation into spaces that define themselves as deeply human. 
Rather than offering efficiency or optimization, the project proposes AI as cultural infrastructure. It is a constrained and transparent system that supports artistic risk while making visible the conditions under which creative knowledge circulates. The Rehearsal Clinic ultimately asks how art might coexist with intelligent systems without surrendering authorship and why some forms of prescription are trusted in art while others provoke resistance.`,

    image: "/images/thunder-western-sky.jpg",
    description: `Thunder in the Western Sky is a comedic country-rap performance piece I developed with my best friend as part of our comedy duo, Mooseknuckles. It is the first completed track from an in-progress album titled Men Having Sex. I want to acknowledge upfront that this work may feel like a curveball within my portfolio; that is intentional. I am interested in exploring a wide range of artistic forms, and this project represents my focused exploration of comedy as both craft and inquiry.
The song centers on an exaggerated cowboy character and uses deliberate vulgarity and absurd humor to examine cultural ideas around masculinity and sexuality. One of the core questions behind the piece is what is considered “acceptable” to laugh at. In particular, we were interested in how male masturbation is often framed as harmless or comedic, while comparable representations of female pleasure are frequently labeled crude or inappropriate. That imbalance is embedded into the structure and tone of the song itself.
Musically, the track blends country conventions with rap, using genre contrast to heighten the absurdity of the character and narrative. Performing in male drag allows masculinity to be pushed into excess, making it visible as a performance rather than an assumed norm.
This project is not intended to provoke for shock alone. Instead, it uses humor, genre play, and exaggeration to surface cultural assumptions that often go unquestioned. Thunder in the Western Sky functions as a proof of concept for Men Having Sex, an evolving album-length project that uses comedy to examine gender, sexuality, and the boundaries of what humor permits.`,

    description: `Earlier this year, I pitched an AI and Art project to the head of Interdisciplinary projects at The Theatre School, Damon Kiely, and he gave me $2000 for the project. This project proposes a way of working with artificial intelligence in art that treats AI as cultural infrastructure rather than a creative author. 
Instead of asking what AI can generate, the project focuses on the invisible labor that drains time from artistic process. In rehearsal and other creative spaces, attention is often consumed by searching, organizing, remembering, and managing logistics rather than experimentation, listening, and discovery. The goal of this project is to explore how small, ethical AI systems might absorb that overhead while leaving authorship, intuition, and aesthetic decision making entirely in human hands.
The work takes the form of a growing ecosystem of AI assisted tools designed specifically for artists. Each tool is limited in scope, transparent in function, and shaped through direct use rather than optimization for scale. Rehearsal Clinic, an AI supported system for accessing Viola Spolin’s improvisational pedagogy in real time, serves as one early proof of concept, but it is only the beginning.
At its core, the project argues that ethical AI in art is not about automation or spectacle. It is about restraint, care, and designing systems that give time back to creative work. By treating AI as support rather than substitution, the project asks how technology might coexist with artistic practice without flattening it.`,
